# Used-car-price-estimator
Built a model to estimate price for used cars by considering various factors like car type, mileage, fuel type, kilometer driven etc. EDA and data preprocessing done in Python using Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn and plots for data visualization. Placed various significant/important features using feature selection techniques to build a generalized model with improved model performance.
Algorithm used: Linear regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regressor etc. 
Grid Search was used for hyyper parameter tunning.
